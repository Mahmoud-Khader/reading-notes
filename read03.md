## New Html5 Layout Elements

*HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the 
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content 
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not 
stopped many web page authors using them already.*

## Headers & Footers
## <header> <footer>

*The header and footer
elements can be used for:*
● *The main header or footer* 
that appears at the top or 
bottom of every page on the 
site.
● *A header or footer for an 
individual article or 
section within the page.*

## Navigation
  nav

  *The nav element is used to 
contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the 
primary site navigation.*

## Articles

*The article element acts as 
a container for any section of a 
page that could stand alone and 
potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual 
article or blog entry, a comment 
or forum post, or any other 
independent piece of content.*

## Aside 

*The aside element has two 
purposes, depending on whether 
it is inside an article
element or not.*

## Section

*The section element groups 
related content together, and 
typically each section would 
have its own heading.*

## Heading Groups 

*The purpose of the hgroup
element is to group together a 
set of one or more h1 through 
h6 elements so that they are 
treated as one single heading.*

## Figure

*It is important to note that the 
article should still make sense 
if the content of the (figure)
element were moved (to another 
part of the page, or even to a 
different page altogether).*
