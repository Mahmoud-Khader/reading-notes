# GitHub Pages
**GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages’ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.**

## Create Your Website
- Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.
![sign in](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/create-new-repo-button.png)
- On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.
![Repo name](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/create-new-repo-screen.png)
- Your website’s files will live in a repository named **username.github.io** (where “username” is your actual GitHub user name). To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab
![settings](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/repo-settings.png)
- If you scroll down on the settings page, you’ll see the **GitHub Pages** section near the bottom. Click the **Choose a theme** button to start the process of creating your site.

- Once you’ve clicked the button, you’ll be directed to the Theme Chooser. You’ll see several theme options in a carousel across the top of the page. Click on the images to preview the themes. Once you’ve selected one, click **Select theme** on the right to move on. It’s easy to change your theme later, so if you’re not sure, just choose one for now.

- Here’s where you’ll write your own content (You can keep the default content for now, if you’d like).

- Once you’re finished editing, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Commit changes**.

- GitHub does all the work to direct visitors to username.github.io to view your new website. This can take up to 10 minutes. After some time has passed, you can open a new tab in your browser to go to your site!
