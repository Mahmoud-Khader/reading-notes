# Loops 

**Loops check a condition,if it return true . a code block will run.
Then the condition will be checked agian and if it still returns true.the code block will run agian.it repeats until the condition returns false.**

*There are three common types of loops :*

1. For 
2. While
3. Do While

### Loop Counters 

**A for loop uses a counter as a condition.
This instructs the code to run a specified number of times.
Here you can see the condition is made up of three statements:**

1. Initilaization : var i = 0 ;
2. Condition : i < 10 ;
3. Update : i++
