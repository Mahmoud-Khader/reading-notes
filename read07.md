# Color With CSS

## Foreground Color

***The color property allows you 
to specify the color of text inside 
an element. You can specify any 
color in CSS in one of three ways:***

1. **rgb values** :*These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90)*
2. **hex codes** : *These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80*
3. **color names** : *There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan*

## Background Color 

***CSS treats each HTML element 
as if it appears in a box, and the 
background-color property 
sets the color of the background 
for that box.***

## Contract 

***When picking foreground and background 
colors, it is important to ensure that there is 
enough contrast for the text to be legible.*** : *(High,Medium,low) Contract*

## CSS3: Opacity (opacity, rgba)

***CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to 
specify the opacity of an element 
and any of its child elements. 
The value is a number between 
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% 
opacity).***

## CSS3: HSL Colors 

***CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive 
way to specify colors using hue, saturation, 
and lightness values.***
- **Hue** : *Hue is the colloquial idea of 
color. In HSL colors, hue is often 
represented as a color circle 
where the angle represents the 
color, although it may also be 
shown as a slider with values 
from 0 to 360.*
- **saturation** : *Saturation is the amount of 
gray in a color. Saturation is 
represented as a percentage. 
100% is full saturation and 0% 
is a shade of gray*
- **lightness** : *Lightness is the amount of 
white (lightness) or black 
(darkness) in a color. Lightness 
is represented as a percentage. 
0% lightness is black, 100% 
lightness is white, and 50% 
lightness is normal. Lightness 
is sometimes referred to as 
luminosity.*

## CSS3:(HSL & HSLA)

***The hsl color property has 
been introduced in CSS3 as an 
alternative way to specify colors. 
The value of the property starts 
with the letters hsl, followed 
by individual values inside 
parentheses for:(HUE,Saturation,Lightness,Alpha)***
