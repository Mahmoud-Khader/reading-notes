# Programming with JavaScript

## Writing a Script 

***To write a script, you need to first 
state your goal and then list the 
tasks that need to be completed in 
order to achieve it. ***
***Start with the big picture of what 
you want to achieve, and break 
that down into smaller steps. ***
1. **Define The Goal** :*First, you need to define the task you want to 
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the 
computer to solve. *

2. **Design The Script** :*To design a script you split the goal out into a series 
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this 
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. *

3. **Code Each Step** : *Each of the steps needs to be written in a 
programming language that the compu ter 
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. *

***Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically.***

***To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).***

## Expressions 

*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking 
there are two types of expressions.* 
1. **EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE** 
2. **EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR 
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A 
SINGLE VALUE **

## Operatiors 

**(Assignment , Comparision , Logical , String , Arithmetic)**

**Basic JavaScript instructions**

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
- strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
- Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

## Functions

***Declaring a Function***

*To create a Function,you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside tje curly braces. This known as a Function declaration*

***Calling a Function***

*Having declared the function , you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of coede , This is known as calling the function*

***Declaring Functions That need information***

*Sometimes a functionneeds specific information to preform its task in such cases , when you declare the function you give it parameters inside the function , the parameters act like variables*

***Calling Functions that need information***

*When you call a function that has parameters,you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments and they can be provided as values or as variables*

***Getting a single value out of a function***

*Some functions return information to the code that called them For example , when they preform a calculation they return the result.*

***Getting multiple values out of a function***

*Functions can return more than one value using an array.*
